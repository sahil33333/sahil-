  <h2>Biography</h2>
  <p>
    Gandhi grew up in a home steeped in religion, and he took for granted religious tolerance and the doctrine of ahimsa (noninjury to all living beings). 
    He studied law in England from 1888 to 1891, and in 1893 he took a job with an Indian firm in South Africa. 
    There he became an effective advocate for Indian rights.
